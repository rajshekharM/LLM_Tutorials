Inﬂaton ﬂuctuations are small wave packets of energy that, according to general relativity, modify the space-time fabric, creating a whole spectrum of curvature perturbations.

A candidate that has recently been exploited with great success is a certain type of supernova explosions at large redshifts. These are stars at the end of their life cycle that become unstable and violently explode in a natural thermonuclear explosion that out-shines their progenitor galaxy. The intensity of the distant ﬂash varies in time, it takes about three weeks to reach its maximum brightness and then it declines over a period of months. Although the maximum luminosity varies from one supernova to another, depending on their original mass, their environment, etc., there is a pattern: brighter explosions last longer than fainter ones. By study- ing the light curves of a reasonably large statistical sample, cosmologists from two competing groups, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-redshift Super-', metadata={'source': '/content/story of our universe.pdf'}), Document(page_content='nova Project, are con(cid:12)dent that they can use this type of supernova as a standard candle. Since the light coming from some of these rare explosions has travelled for a large fraction of the size of the universe, one expects to be able to infer from their distribution the spatial curvature and the rate of expansion of the universe. One of the surprises revealed by these observations is that the universe appears to be accelerating instead of decelerating, as was expected from the general attraction of matter; something seems to be acting as a repulsive force on very large scales. The most natural explanation for this is the existence of a cosmological constant, a di(cid:11)use vacuum energy that permeates all space and, as explained above, gives the universe an acceleration that tends to separate gravitationally bound systems from each other. The origin of such a vacuum energy is one of the biggests prob- lems of modern physics.

Why isn’t all the energy in photons, which would have inevitably redshifted away in a cold universe devoid of life? How did we end up being matter dominated? Everything we see in the universe, from planets and stars, to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, is made out of matter, so where did the antimatter in the universe go? Is this the result of an accident, a happy chance occurrence during the evolution of the universe, or is it an inevitable consequence of some asymmetry in the laws of nature?

From there on, the universe expanded isoentropically, cooling down as it expanded, in the way described by the standard hot Big Bang model. Thus the origin of the Big Bang itself, and the matter and energy we observe in the universe today, can be traced back to the epoch in which the inﬂaton energy density decayed into particles. Such a process is called reheating of the universe.', metadata={'source': '/content/story of our universe.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Recent developments in the theory of reheating suggest that the decay of the inﬂaton energy could be explosive due to the coherent oscillations of the inﬂaton, which induce its stimulated decay.

The number of particles produced this way is exponentially large, which may explain the extraordinarily large entropy, of order 1089 particles, in our observable patch of the universe today.

The standard model describes three types of interactions: the electromagnetic force, the strong and the weak nuclear forces. These forces are transmitted by the corresponding particles: the photon, the gluon and the W and Z bosons. The theory also requires a scalar particle, the Higgs particle, responsible for the masses of quarks and leptons and the breaking of the electroweak symmetry at an energy scale 1000 times the mass of the proton.

Second, C and CP symmetry must be violated, in order to di(cid:11)erentiate between matter and antimatter, otherwise B non-conserving interactions would produce baryons and antibaryons at the same rate, thus main- taining zero net baryon number. Third, these processes should occur out of thermal equilibrium, otherwise particles and antiparticles would be produced at the same rate. The standard model is baryon symmetric at the classical level, but violates B at the quantum level, through the chiral anomaly.

Such scales will soon be explored by particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the European Centre for Particle Physics) and by the Tevatron at Fermilab. The mechanism for baryon production in the early universe in these models relies on the strength of the elec- troweak phase transition, as the universe cooled and the symmetry was broken. Only for strongly (cid:12)rst-order phase transitions is the universe su(cid:14)ciently far from equilibrium to produce enough baryon asymmetry.

Electroweak baryogenesis could then take place during that epoch, soon after the end of low energy inﬂation at the electroweak scale. Such models can be constructed but re- quire a specially ﬂat direction (a very small mass for the inﬂaton) during inﬂation, in order to satisfy the constraints from the amplitude of temperature anisotropies seen by COBE.

If, during this stage, fundamental or e(cid:11)ective interactions that are B, C and CP violating were fast enough compared to the rate of expansion, the universe could have ended with the observed baryon asymmetry of one part in 1010, or one baryon per 109 photons today, as deduced from observations of the light element abundances.
